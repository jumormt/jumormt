###



<p> I am a Post-Doctoral Researcher at <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/engineering/our-schools/computer-science-and-engineering">School of Computer Science and Engineering</a>, <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/homepage/">University of New South Wales (UNSW)</a>, working with Scientia Associate Professor <a href="https://yuleisui.github.io/">Yulei Sui</a>. My research lies at the intersection of programming languages and software engineering, with a particular focus on enhancing software reliability and performance through software analysis and verification techniques. I am also interested in the synergy between artificial intelligence, particularly large language models, and software engineering.
