<h3 align="left">👩‍💻  About Me</h3>

###



<p> I am a Post-Doctoral Researcher at <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/engineering/our-schools/computer-science-and-engineering">School of Computer Science and Engineering</a>, <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/homepage/">University of New South Wales (UNSW)</a>, working with Scientia Associate Professor <a href="https://yuleisui.github.io/">Yulei Sui</a>. My research lies at the intersection of Programming Languages (PL) and Software Engineering (SE), with a particular focus on enhancing the reliability and performance of modern software systems through software analysis and verification techniques. I am also exploring the integration of artificial intelligence, such as graph neural networks and language models, with classical PL/SE tasks to further enhance these domains. If you have innovative ideas you'd like to share, please don't hesitate to reach out to me via xiao Dot cheng AT unsw Dot edu Dot au.
